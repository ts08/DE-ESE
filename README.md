# DE-ESE
An oasis of code to help cross the desert of data analysis.

The file "CSV read testing.ipynb" is a simple jupyter notebook that loads CSV data (from the Basytec cycler, say) into a pandas dataframe and plots some figures of interest.

This github repo can hopefully be the central place where the group shares code for efficient data post-processing and statistical analysis.
